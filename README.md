This repository provides the _Interactive Pipeline Selection Tool_ from Luppi et al., "Systematic evaluation of fMRI data-processing pipelines for consistent functional connectomics" Nature Communications (2024) ([published article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48781-5)).

The _Pipeline Selection Tool_ provides the results of systematically assessing 768 pipelines for obtaining a functional connectivity network from (preprocessed) functional MRI data.
The pipelines consist of all possible combinations of the following steps:
(i) Global signal regression (GSR or no GSR);
(ii) Definition of network nodes: AAL, Brainnetome, Glasser, Lausanne multi-scale anatomical (129, 234 or 463 nodes), Schaefer-Tian multi-scale functional (116, 232, or 454 nodes),
Independent Components Analysis (100, 200, or 300 components). 
(iii) Number of nodes: approximately 100, 200 or 300-400.
(iv) Edge definition: Pearson correlation or Mutual Information. 
(v) Edge filtering: pre-specified density (retaining 5%, 10%, or 20% of total edges, or matching the density of the structural connectome); pre-specified minimum weight (0.3 or 0.5);
or data-driven methods (Efficiency Cost Optimisation, and Orthogonal Minimum Spanning Trees).
(vi) Binary or weighted networks. 

Each pipeline is benchmarked against the following criteria for trustworthy functional connectomics:
**Criterion (I)**: Avoiding random test-retest differences.
**Criterion (II):** Detecting true experimental differences (reconfiguration induced by anaesthesia).
**Criterion (III):** Detecting inter-individual differences.
**Criterion (IV):** Avoiding systematic motion-induced differences.
**Criterion (V):** Producing non-empty networks.

To further ensure that results and recommendations are generalisable, each criterion is assessed for each pipeline in four test-retest datasets (spanning ~1h, 2-4 weeks, 1-11 and 5-16 months) including different acquisition parameters and preprocessing/denoising (aCompCor and FIX-ICA).

As reported in the peper, *the majority of pipelines do not meet all criteria consistently*.
We identified a number of pipelines that satisfy every criterion in every dataset, whose use we recommend.
However, we also provide the _Pipeline Selection Tool_ so that users can choose pipelines based on their own combination of criteria and requirements. 
To make this repository self-contained, a PDF _Guide to the Pipeline Selection Tool_ is also provided.
The paper (available Open Access) provides a full description of each criterion and dataset.
